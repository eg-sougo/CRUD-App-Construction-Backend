Project Overview
The Construction Project Management API is a RESTful backend application built using ASP.NET Core Web API.
It helps construction teams manage projects, tasks, and engineers/supervisors, while providing secure access using JWT-based authentication.
This project is part of a construction domain capstone, focusing on clean REST design, validation, authentication, and CRUD operations using a relational database.

Tech Stack
•	Backend: ASP.NET Core Web API (.NET)
•	Language: C#
•	Database: PostgreSQL
•	ORM: Entity Framework Core
•	Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Token)
•	Testing: Postman
•	Version Control: Git & GitHub

Core Features
•	JWT-based authentication & authorization
•	Secure access to protected endpoints
•	CRUD operations for Projects
•	CRUD operations for Tasks
•	CRUD operations for Engineers / Supervisors
•	Assign tasks to projects and engineers
•	Track task status (Planned, In Progress, Completed)
•	Input validation using Data Annotations
•	REST-compliant endpoints with correct HTTP status codes
•	Swagger UI for testing



Authentication (JWT)
•	Users authenticate using login credentials
•	On successful login, a JWT token is generated
•	The token must be included in the Authorization header for protected endpoints
	Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>
•	Unauthorized requests return 401 Unauthorized
•	Role-based or claim-based authorization can be extended if required

API Endpoints (Overview)
Authentication
•	POST /api/auth/login – Authenticate user and generate JWT token
•	POST /api/auth/register – Register a new user (if enabled)
Projects
•	GET /api/projects
•	GET /api/projects/{id}
•	POST /api/projects
•	PUT /api/projects/{id}
•	DELETE /api/projects/{id}
Tasks
•	GET /api/tasks
•	GET /api/tasks/{id}
•	GET /api/projects/{projectId}/tasks
•	POST /api/tasks
•	PUT /api/tasks/{id}
•	DELETE /api/tasks/{id}
Engineers / Supervisors
•	GET /api/engineers
•	GET /api/engineers/{id}
•	POST /api/engineers
•	PUT /api/engineers/{id}
•	DELETE /api/engineers/{id}


Setup & Execution Steps
1.	Clone the repository
2.	git clone https://github.com/eg-sougo/CRUD-App-Construction-Backend.git
3.	Open the project
o	Open the solution in Visual Studio
4.	Configure JWT & Database
o	Update appsettings.json:
	Database connection string
	JWT settings (Issuer, Audience, Secret Key)
5.	Apply migrations
6.	Update-Database
7.	Run the application
o	Press F5 or run via Visual Studio
8.	Access Swagger
9.	https://localhost:{port}/swagger
10.	Authorize in Swagger
o	Click Authorize
o	Enter:
o	Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>

Key Assumptions
•	Each task belongs to a single project
•	Tasks are assigned to one engineer
•	JWT token is required to access protected endpoints
•	Authentication is stateless
•	Role-based authorization is minimal / basic
